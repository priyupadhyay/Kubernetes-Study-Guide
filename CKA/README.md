# CERTIFIED KUBERNETES ADMINISTRATOR (CKA)

## About the program
---
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation offers a certification program that allows users to demonstrate their competence in a hands-on, command-line environment.

The purpose of the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) program is to provide assurance that CKAs have the skills, knowledge, and competency to perform the responsibilities of Kubernetes administrators.

It is an online, proctored, performance-based test that requires solving multiple issues from a command line.

The CKA program is separate from Kubernetes Certified Service Provider (KCSP) program. You can become a CKA without needing to be involved with a KCSP, but for a company to become a KCSP it must employ at least three CKAs. You can learn more about the KCSP program.

CNCF has open sourced the curriculum around which the CKA exam has been created for the benefit of companies offering training. CNCF offers wholesale pricing on our exams to training companies purchasing in bulk. For more information, please contact trainingpartners@cncf.io.
